## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to use data from a previous API project where I pulled data from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and create a dashboard/website to showcase that data.

## Tools Used

1. Python (Data Aggregation/Cleaning)

2. Github (Publishing of Results and Analysis)

3. Atom

4. Jupyter Notebook (Originally used to produce visualizations)

5. Matplotlib (Originally used to produce visualizations)

## Steps 

1. Used a `Bootstrap` template from https://startbootstrap.com/template/scrolling-nav to get started

2. Utilized the very easy to follow Bootstrap format of the template to bring in images and write descriptions of the data
